# food-delivery-backend-clone
This repository contains crude implementation of REST APIs for online food delivery services. The APIs allows users to login, order, check delivery status, add to cart, etc. The APIs was developed in a short span of 4-5 days as part of an interview selection process alongside my daily job.
